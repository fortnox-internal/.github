# Welcome to Fortnox on GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Fortnox GitHub organization! Weâ€™re excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get started with GitHub and introduce you to our collaboration practices.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for hosting code, collaborating on projects, and tracking issues and changes. Here at Fortnox, we use GitHub to manage our source code, documentation, and workflows.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Account**
   - You will receive an invitation email from our organization. Simply click the green **Join** button in the email.
   - If you're new to GitHub, you will be prompted to create a new account directly through the invitation.
   - If you already have an account, you will be asked to sign in to your existing account to accept the invitation.
   - Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): To protect your account from unauthorized access, it's crucial to enable 2FA. Follow [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) to set this up.

2. **Configure Your Profile**
   - Add a profile picture and bio.
   - Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for security.

3. **Install Git**
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your computer.
   - Configure your username and email:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@fortnox.se"
     ```

## Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo):** A project or collection of files.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of your project used for development.
- **Commit:** A saved change in your project history.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge your changes into another branch or repo.
- **Issue:** A way to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests.

## Basic Workflow

1. **Clone a Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fortnox-internal/your-repo.git

## Pro Tip: Use GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a graphical interface over the command line, try [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).  
It makes it easy to clone repositories, create branches, commit changes, and open pull requestsâ€”all with a simple, user-friendly interface.  
Great for both beginners and experienced users!
